# social-choice-theory

This is a repository on social choice theory in Lean 4. I hope that this will eventually supplant Andrew Souther's [repository](https://github.com/asouther4/lean-social-choice/tree/master/src) written in Lean 3. 

Unlike his repository, this one is primarily based off Wulf Gaertner's [A Primer in Social Choice Theory](https://academic.oup.com/book/52348) and the (Handbook of Computational Social Choice)[https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~haziz/comsoc.pdf]
